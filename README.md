```

----------
For Kali Linux

Identify the name of your card

```bash
iwconfig
```

Set interface down + monitor mode + activate interface + TX power (as root)
----------
Replace in the below script the wlan name of the wifi device that you like to use

```bash
sudo rfkill unblock all
```

```bash
sudo airmon-ng check kill && sudo service NetworkManager restart && sudo ip link set wlan0 down && sudo iw dev wlan0 set type monitor && sudo ip link set wlan0 up && sudo iw wlan0 set txpower fixed 3737373737373 && sudo service NetworkManager start
```

or

```bash
sudo ip link set wlan0 down && sudo iw dev wlan0 set type monitor && sudo ip link set wlan0 up && sudo iw wlan0 set txpower fixed 3737373737373 && sudo service NetworkManager start
```

or

```bash
sudo ip link set wlan0 down && sudo iw dev wlan0 set type monitor && sudo ip link set wlan0 up && sudo service NetworkManager start
```

You may also uncheck the box "Automatically connect to this network when it is avaiable" in nm-connection-editor. This only works if you have a saved wifi connection.

Wifite is designed to use all known methods for retrieving the password of a wireless access point (router).  These methods include:
1. WPS: The [Offline Pixie-Dust attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup#Offline_brute-force_attack)
1. WPS: The [Online Brute-Force PIN attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup#Online_brute-force_attack)
2. WPA: The [WPA Handshake Capture](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) + offline crack.
3. WPA: The [PMKID Hash Capture](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) + offline crack.
4. WEP: Various known attacks against WEP, including *fragmentation*, *chop-chop*, *aireplay*, etc.

## Real-Time Hashcat Cracking

Wifite can now attempt to crack captured PMKIDs and WPA/WPA2 handshakes in real-time using Hashcat running in the background. This is useful for getting quick results on potentially weak passwords while other Wifite operations (like scanning or attacking other targets) continue.

**Enabling the Feature:**
*   To enable this feature, use the `--hashcat-realtime` command-line argument.

**Wordlist Configuration:**
*   `--hashcat-realtime-wordlist-dir <directory>`: By default, Wifite will iterate through wordlists found in `/usr/share/wordlists/`. You can specify a different directory using this option.
*   `--hashcat-realtime-wordlist-file <file>`: To use a single, specific wordlist for real-time attempts (which overrides the directory search), use this option. This is recommended for faster, targeted attacks against potentially common passwords.

**Custom Hashcat Options:**
*   `--hashcat-realtime-options "<options_string>"`: Pass custom command-line options directly to Hashcat. For example, to use a specific rule file: `--hashcat-realtime-options "-r /path/to/rules/best64.rule"`. Ensure the options are quoted if they contain spaces.

**CPU/GPU Control:**
*   `--hashcat-realtime-force-cpu`: Force Hashcat to use only CPU resources (adds `--force -D 1` or similar to Hashcat). This can be useful if GPU resources are needed for other tasks or if GPU cracking is unstable.
*   `--hashcat-realtime-gpu-devices <device_ids>`: Specify which GPU devices Hashcat should use (e.g., `1,3` for `--opencl-device-types 2 --opencl-device-ids 1,3`). Consult Hashcat documentation for device selection.

**How It Works:**
*   When a PMKID is captured (via `hcxdumptool`) or a WPA handshake is obtained and converted to `.hccapx` format (via `hcxpcapngtool`), Wifite will initiate a Hashcat session if real-time cracking is enabled.
*   Real-time cracking operates on one target's hash at a time. If a new hash (e.g., from a different target) is captured, Wifite may switch the real-time cracking session to the new target or queue it.
*   If a password is cracked, other attacks against that specific target are typically stopped, and the password is saved to `cracked.txt` and `cracked.json`.
*   Status messages from Hashcat (speed, progress) will be displayed periodically in the Wifite console.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Resource Intensive:** This feature can significantly increase CPU and/or GPU usage. Monitor system performance, especially on resource-constrained devices.
*   **Hashcat & Dependencies:** A working installation of Hashcat (and its drivers for GPU cracking, e.g., OpenCL runtimes) and `hcxtools` (for `.hccapx` conversion) is required.
*   **Experimental:** While functional, consider this an advanced feature. Behavior, performance, and output parsing may vary based on your system, drivers, Hashcat version, and the specific options used.

Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------
Wifite is designed specifically for the latest version of [**Kali** Linux](https://www.kali.org/). [ParrotSec](https://www.parrotsec.org/). [Ubuntu](http://releases.ubuntu.com/disco/) is also supported.

Other pen-testing distributions (such as BackBox or Ubuntu) may have outdated versions of the tools used by Wifite. Do not expect full support unless you are using the latest versions of the *Required Tools*, and also [patched wireless drivers that support injection](). For best results, especially with newer standards like WPA3, OWE, Wi-Fi 6/7, ensure your core tools (`airodump-ng`, `hcxdumptool`, `hashcat`, etc.) are up-to-date, potentially by building from source.

Components that use Wifite
--------------
First and foremost, you will need a wireless card capable of "Monitor Mode" and packet injection (see [this tutorial for checking if your wireless card is compatible](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatible_cards) and also [this guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup#Offline_brute-force_attack)). There are many cheap wireless cards that plug into USB available from online stores.

Second, only the latest versions of these programs are supported and Wifite needs to work properly:


* `python`: Wifite is compatible with both `python2` and `python3`.
* [`iwconfig`](https://wiki.debian.org/iwconfig): For identifying wireless devices already in Monitor Mode.
* [`ifconfig`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifconfig): For starting/stopping wireless devices.
* [`Aircrack-ng`](http://aircrack-ng.org/) suite, includes:
   * [`airmon-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/airmon-ng): For enumerating and enabling Monitor Mode on wireless devices.
   * [`aircrack-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/aircrack-ng): For cracking WEP .cap files and WPA handshake captures.
   * [`aireplay-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/aireplay-ng): For deauthing access points, replaying capture files, various WEP attacks.
   * [`airodump-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/airodump-ng): For target scanning & capture file generation.
   * [`packetforge-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/packetforge-ng): For forging capture files.

* [`tshark`](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html): For detecting WPS networks and inspecting handshake capture files.
* [`reaver`](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x): For WPS Pixie-Dust & brute-force attacks.
   * Note: Reaver's `wash` tool can be used to detect WPS networks if `tshark` is not found.
* [`bully`](https://github.com/aanarchyy/bully): For WPS Pixie-Dust & brute-force attacks.
   * Alternative to Reaver. Specify `--bully` to use Bully instead of Reaver.
   * Bully is also used to fetch PSK if `reaver` cannot after cracking WPS PIN.
* [`coWPAtty`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/cowpatty): For detecting handshake captures.
* [`pyrit`](https://github.com/JPaulMora/Pyrit): For detecting handshake captures.
* [`hashcat`](https://hashcat.net/): For cracking PMKID hashes.
   * [`hcxdumptool`](https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxdumptool): For capturing PMKID hashes.
   * [`hcxpcaptool`](https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxtools): For converting PMKID packet captures into `hashcat`'s format.

   * Note: Some tools don't play well on 5GHz channels (e.g. `aireplay-ng`)
* Stores cracked passwords and handshakes to the current directory (`--cracked`)
   * Includes information about the cracked access point (Name, BSSID, Date, etc).
* Easy to try to crack handshakes or PMKID hashes against a wordlist (`--crack`)

What's new?
-----------
Comparing this repo to the "old wifite" @ https://github.com/derv82/wifite

* **Less bugs**
   * Cleaner process management. Does not leave processes running in the background (the old `wifite` was bad about this).
   * No longer "one monolithic script". Has working unit tests. Pull requests are less-painful!
* **Speed**
   * Target access points are refreshed every second instead of every 5 seconds.
* **Accuracy**
   * Displays realtime Power level of currently-attacked target.
   * Displays more information during an attack (e.g. % during WEP chopchop attacks, Pixie-Dust step index, etc)
* **Educational**
   * The `--verbose` option (expandable to `-vv` or `-vvv`) shows which commands are executed & the output of those commands.
   * This can help debug why Wifite is not working for you. Or so you can learn how these tools are used.
* More-actively developed.
* Python 3 support.
* Sweet new ASCII banner.

### WPA3, OWE, and Wi-Fi 6/7 Support
* Wifite can now identify WPA3-SAE and OWE (Enhanced Open) networks.
* Displays inferred Wi-Fi standards (802.11ax/Wi-Fi 6, 802.11be/Wi-Fi 7) based on network capabilities shown by `airodump-ng`.
* For WPA3-SAE targets, Wifite prioritizes PMKID attacks. Traditional 4-way handshake capture (ineffective against WPA3-SAE) is skipped, and the user is informed.
* Ensuring up-to-date versions of core tools (Aircrack-ng suite, HCXTools, Hashcat) is recommended for optimal Wi-Fi 6/7 and WPA3 support.

What's gone?
------------
* Some command-line arguments (`--wept`, `--wpst`, and other confusing switches).
   * You can still access some of these obscure options, try `wifite -h -v`

What's not new?
---------------
* (Mostly) Backwards compatible with the original `wifite`'s arguments.
* Same text-based interface everyone knows and loves.
